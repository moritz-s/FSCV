*  experiment
   %The collision sweep experiment provides a unique access .
   A common experiment in a simple nerve chamber is the measurement of the
   propagation velocity with extracellular electrodes. We additionally measure
   the extracellular shape of the AP as a function of the delay between stimuli
   from opposing ends. This reveals additional features that are informative
   with respect to the process of AP annihilation, and those are available
   without any further assumptions.
   
   If it is assumed that the AP does not change its shape while it is
   propagating (stationary propagation), then the delay translates into a
   displacement of the point of collision. This provides the spatial width of
   the collision, it determines a length scale $\lambdastar$ related to the
   width of the AP.

   The widely used length constant $\lambda$ corresponds to the steady state
   limit of a current injection that is damped by membrane leak current. On the
   fast timescales of nerve signaling the contribution of such a leak current is
   negligible. However, if the leak current is neglected in a model then the
   length $\lambda$ diverges, which clearly puts the usefulness of $\lambda$ in
   question.
   
   In contrast, the length $\lambdastar$ corresponds to the AP, or more
   precisely to the fast process of capacitive charging during AP propagation.
   These length scales are not really related, when nerve signaling by APs is
   investigated then $\lambdastar$ and not $\lambda$ is the length scale of
   interest.

   Note that such an additional observable can have versatile applications e.g.\
   to characterize different types of nerves or to measure the effect of
   chemical agents (drug testing). 
   
   We use this information to build models of the excitable membrane.
   
*  model
   The access to $\lambdastar$ reduces the parameterspace for models of
   excitable membranes. The first model we apply is the TM model, after the
   propagation velocity and the length $\labdastar$ is determined, has only one
   degree of freedom left, which is the total amplitude of the AP. The shape and
   dynamic of the nerve signal is fully determined.

   The TM model lacks a phase of repolarization, which can easily be added by an
   ad-hock expression. An additional parameter is thereby introduced, which is
   the repolarization timescale $\tau_R$. Again, the collision sweep measurement
   puts the required constraints on the model so that for a given repolarization
   expression we can precisely fit the timescale $\tau_R$.

   (Another parameter for drug testing !?!)

   The 
   Why n to the 4
   TM is the ultimate purity!

   It is exactly the kinkiness of the HH.
   HH has an inherent falt in the sharpness of the transition.
