*  experiment
   %The collision sweep experiment provides a unique access .
   A common experiment in a simple nerve chamber is the measurement of the
   propagation velocity with extracellular electrodes. We additionally measure
   the extracellular shape of the AP as a function of the delay between stimuli
   from opposing ends. This reveals additional features (e.g. $\lambdastar$,
   $\tau_R$) that carry information about the electric AP and its annihilation.
   annihilation. The extracellular spike of collisions can also be observed in
   purkinje fiber systems, artificially induced and also occur naturally \cite{spach}. 
   (also Spach) The membrane potential is not affected.
   
   
   If it is assumed that the AP does not change its shape while it is
   propagating (stationary propagation), then the delay translates into a
   displacement of the point of collision. This provides the spatial structure
   of the collision.

   The width of the AP is determined by $\lambdastar$ (via TM model).

   The widely used length constant $\lambda$ corresponds to the steady state
   limit of a current injection that is damped by membrane leak current. On the
   fast timescales of nerve signaling the contribution of such a leak current is
   negligible. However, if the leak current is neglected in a model then the
   length $\lambda$ diverges, which puts the usefulness of $\lambda$ in
   question. 
   
   In contrast, the length $\lambdastar$ corresponds to the AP, or more
   precisely to the fast process of capacitive charging during AP propagation.
   These length scales are not really related, when nerve signaling by APs is
   investigated then $\lambdastar$ and not $\lambda$ is the length scale of
   interest.

   Independent of the assumption of a homogenious nerve fiber
   Additional observables can have versatile applications e.g.\
   to characterize different types of nerves or to identify effects of
   drugs. 
   
   We use this information to build and refine models of excitable membranes.
   
*  model
   The access to $\lambdastar$ reduces the parameterspace for models of
   excitable membranes. The first model we apply is the TM model, after the
   propagation velocity and the length $\labdastar$ is determined, has only one
   degree of freedom left, which is the total amplitude of the AP. The shape and
   dynamic of the nerve signal is fully determined.

   The TM model describes the propagating process of excitation, but not the
   re-polarization. The deviation to the experimental AP is well seperated 
   
   The experimental behaviour can be mimicked by added by an ad-hock expression.
   
   The expression we chose to mimic the re-polarization is an exponential decay
   that is delayed, by letting the value start at 0 and using the 4-th power.
   
   Such a delay seperates the re-polarization current from the initial rising phase.
   Thereby the behavior of the TM model is (almost) restored, and the analytical
   expressions for $v_p$ and $\lambdastar$ remain good approximations.
   
   
   This is a simple expression for a delayed relaxation (e.g. intensively used
   in the HH expressions), but there are many other candidates for such
   expressions\cite{cole62}.

   An additional parameter is thereby introduced, which is
   the repolarization timescale $\tau_R$. Again, the collision sweep measurement
   puts the required constraints on the model so that for a given repolarization
   expression we can precisely fit the timescale $\tau_R$.

   
   


   Why n to the 4
   TM is the ultimate purity!

   It is exactly the kinkiness of the HH.
   HH has an inherent falt in the sharpness of the transition.
